## BottomGear.refresh() method

Collapses any submenu open back to the gear menu.

**Signature:**

```typescript
refresh(): void;
```
**Returns:**

void

## Remarks

Should be called by the UI plugin that added a gear item with a submenu when the latter is closed (e.g., when a "back" button is clicked).
