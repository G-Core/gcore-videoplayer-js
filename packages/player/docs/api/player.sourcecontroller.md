`PLUGIN` that is responsible for managing the automatic failover between sources.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class SourceController extends CorePlugin 
```
**Extends:** CorePlugin

## Remarks

Have a look at the [source failover diagram](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLiN15tY=/?share_link_id=390327585787) for the details on how sources ordering and selection works.

This plugin does not expose any public methods apart from required by the Clappr plugin interface. It is supposed to work autonomously.

## Example


```ts
import { SourceController } from '@gcorevideo/player'

Player.registerPlugin(SourceController)
```
