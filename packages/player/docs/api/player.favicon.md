## Favicon class

`PLUGIN` that changes the favicon according to the player's state.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class Favicon extends CorePlugin 
```
**Extends:** CorePlugin

## Remarks

There are three states: stopped, playing and paused.

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `Favicon` class.
